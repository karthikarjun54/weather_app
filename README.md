# Build a Weather App
### Description:
My task is to create a simple weather app using Flutter that fetches weather data from a
public weather API and displays it to the user. The app should have two main screens: a
location selection screen and a weather display screen.
### Screen 1: Location Selection Screen:
- The user should be able to input a city name or select a city from a predefined list.
- Use any public weather API of your choice (e.g., OpenWeatherMap, WeatherAPI) to fetch weather data based on the selected location.
- Display a loading indicator while fetching data.
- Handle errors gracefully and display appropriate messages if the API request fails.
### Screen 2: Weather Display Screen:
- Once the data is fetched successfully, display the following information:
  - City name
  - Current temperature
  - Weather condition (e.g., sunny, cloudy, rainy) with an appropriate weather icon
  - Min and max temperature for the day
  - Humidity and wind speed
